# RetinaFace in PyTorch

A [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) implementation of [RetinaFace: Single-stage Dense Face Localisation in the Wild](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.00641).

## Additional features
- Added Face Alignment https://github.com/licksylick/retinaface_with_face_alignment/blob/9ceb46a270b8a5037024b328d92b1f75b2585429/face_alignment.py#L7
- Added CPU-support (M1 also) for train/val

    python train.py --network resnet50 --num_workers 1 --cpu_usage True

## Installation
##### Clone and install
1. git clone https://github.com/biubug6/Pytorch_Retinaface.git

2. Pytorch version 1.1.0+ and torchvision 0.3.0+ are needed.

3. Codes are based on Python 3

##### Data
Link: from [google cloud](https://drive.google.com/open?id=11UGV3nbVv1x9IC--_tK3Uxf7hA6rlbsS) or [baidu cloud](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1jIp9t30oYivrAvrgUgIoLQ) Password: ruck

## Training
We provide restnet50 and mobilenet0.25 as backbone network to train model.
We trained Mobilenet0.25 on imagenet dataset and get 46.58%  in top 1. If you do not wish to train the model, we also provide trained model. Pretrain model  and trained model are put in [google cloud](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1oZRSG0ZegbVkVwUd8wUIQx8W7yfZ_ki1) and [baidu cloud](https://pan.baidu.com/s/12h97Fy1RYuqMMIV-RpzdPg) Password: fstq . The model could be put as follows:
```Shell
  ./weights/
      mobilenet0.25_Final.pth
      mobilenetV1X0.25_pretrain.tar
      Resnet50_Final.pth
```
1. Before training, you can check network configuration (e.g. batch_size, min_sizes and steps etc..) in ``data/config.py and train.py``.

2. Train the model using WIDER FACE:
  ```Shell
  CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1,2,3 python train.py --network resnet50 or
  CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python train.py --network mobile0.25
  ```


## Evaluation
### Evaluation widerface val
1. Generate txt file
```Shell
python test_widerface.py --trained_model weight_file --network mobile0.25 or resnet50
```
2. Evaluate txt results. Demo come from [Here](https://github.com/wondervictor/WiderFace-Evaluation)
```Shell
cd ./widerface_evaluate
python setup.py build_ext --inplace
python evaluation.py
```
3. You can also use widerface official Matlab evaluate demo in [Here](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/WIDERFace/WiderFace_Results.html)
### Evaluation FDDB

1. Download the images [FDDB](https://drive.google.com/open?id=17t4WULUDgZgiSy5kpCax4aooyPaz3GQH) to:
```Shell
./data/FDDB/images/
```

2. Evaluate the trained model using:
```Shell
python test_fddb.py --trained_model weight_file --network mobile0.25 or resnet50
```

3. Download [eval_tool](https://bitbucket.org/marcopede/face-eval) to evaluate the performance.
